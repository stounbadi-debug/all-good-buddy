# ü§ñ Auto Profile Builder Integration into tab.cc Platform

## üìò Linked Programme:
**Tab Platform Modernization & AI Enhancement**

## üéØ Goal / Purpose:
Integrate Yassir's enhanced AI Profile Builder into the existing tab.cc platform to provide creators and industry professionals with automated, intelligent profile generation capabilities. This epic serves the strategic goal of modernizing tab.cc with AI-first features while demonstrating our re-platforming methodology from Ruby on Rails to Next.js/Nest.js architecture.

**Context from Team Feedback:**
- Pete identified this as a "top contender" for the first comprehensive re-platforming test
- The profile builder demonstrates 99.2% success rate with comprehensive error handling
- Supports multiple platforms (IMDB, LinkedIn, GitHub, Wikipedia) with dual processing modes
- Already includes advanced features like media galleries, biography enhancement, and export capabilities

**Business Value:**
- Reduce profile creation time for creators from hours to minutes (demonstrated in presentation)
- Increase profile completeness and quality through AI enhancement (full biography generation vs basic IMDB data)
- Demonstrate successful migration pattern for other tab.cc modules
- Provide competitive advantage in creator onboarding and discovery
- Enable tab.cc to offer AI-first profile creation that competitors lack

## üìè Scope:

### ‚úÖ In Scope:
- **Migration Strategy**: Develop reusable methodology for Ruby on Rails ‚Üí Next.js/Nest.js migration
- **AI Profile Builder Integration**: Embed Yassir's existing profile builder functionality into tab.cc
  - Dual processing modes (ScrapingBee + Gemini AI, and integrated backend)
  - Media gallery with clickable images and biography enhancement
  - Export capabilities with structured data output
  - Support for IMDB, LinkedIn, GitHub, Wikipedia platforms
- **User Experience Design**: Create seamless UX flow within existing tab.cc interface
- **Backend API Integration**: Connect profile builder APIs with tab.cc user management
- **Data Migration**: Ensure existing tab.cc profiles can be enhanced with AI capabilities
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing of integrated functionality
- **Documentation**: Create migration playbook for future module migrations

### ‚ùå Out of Scope:
- Complete tab.cc platform rewrite (only profile module)
- New AI model development (use existing Gemini/ScrapingBee integration)
- Mobile app integration (web platform only)
- Advanced analytics dashboard (separate epic)
