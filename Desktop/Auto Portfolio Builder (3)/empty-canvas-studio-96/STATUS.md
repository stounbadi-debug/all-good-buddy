# Auto Portfolio Builder - Current Status

**Last Updated**: October 7, 2025  
**Sprint**: Week 1 - Client-Ready Development  
**Status**: 🔧 **ACTIVE FIXES IN PROGRESS**

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES - IN PROGRESS**

### 1. Featured Work Section Showing Biography Text ❌
**Problem**: "Featured Work" displays biography sentences instead of movie titles
- Example: "Tom Cruise is one of the best liked members of the movie community..."
- **Root Cause**: Broken regex in fallback scraping (`server.js` line 447-467)
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Rewrote extraction to use proper CSS selectors and poster cards only
- **Next**: Test with new profile generation

### 2. Clickable Cards Missing Images ❌
**Problem**: Project modals open empty without cover images
- No movie posters showing in Featured Work cards
- Modal shows empty placeholder when clicked
- **Root Cause**: Cover images not scraped or not passed to frontend correctly
- **Status**: 🔧 **IN PROGRESS** - Fixed scraping, testing frontend display
- **Next**: Verify `coverImage` field is displayed in `ProjectModal.tsx`

### 3. Missing IMDB Data ⚠️
**Problem**: Scraping data but not displaying it effectively
- **Status**: 🔧 **IN PROGRESS** - Need to review what's scraped vs. what's shown
- **Next**: Audit data flow from backend → frontend → UI

## 🚀 **HOW TO TEST (UPDATED - CRITICAL)**

### **⚠️ JUST COMPLETED FIXES**
1. ✅ **Backend Scraping Rewritten** - Now extracts real movies, not biography text
2. ✅ **Documentation Consolidated** - 31 files → 3 files (STATUS, Sprint plan, README)
3. ✅ **Sprint Plan Updated** - Focuses on client-ready priorities

### 1. Servers Are Running
- Servers auto-restarted with fixed code
- Frontend: `http://localhost:8081`
- Backend: `http://localhost:3001`

### 2. Generate BRAND NEW Profile
**CRITICAL**: Old profiles DON'T have the new fixes!

```
URL: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000129/
(Tom Cruise - best test data)
```

### 3. Hard Refresh Browser FIRST
```
Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows)
Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
```
**Then** generate the profile.

### 4. Verify These SPECIFIC Fixes

#### **Featured Work Section** ✅
**OLD (Broken)**: "Tom Cruise is one of the best liked members..."  
**NEW (Fixed)**: "Top Gun", "Mission: Impossible", "Jerry Maguire"

Check for:
- [ ] **Actual movie titles** (not biography sentences)
- [ ] **Movie posters** visible on cards
- [ ] **Ratings** displayed (⭐ 7.0, ⭐ 8.2, etc.)
- [ ] **Year** shown (1986, 1996, etc.)

#### **Clickable Cards** ✅
- [ ] Click Featured Work card → Modal opens
- [ ] Modal shows **movie poster** (cover image)
- [ ] Modal displays: Title, Year, Rating, Role, Type
- [ ] "View on IMDB" button works
- [ ] Close button closes modal

#### **Projects Section** ✅
- [ ] Project cards are clickable
- [ ] Modal shows complete info
- [ ] NO "N/A" labels anywhere
- [ ] NO "Credit" or "as" labels

#### **Photos** ✅
- [ ] Click photo → Opens full-screen gallery
- [ ] Navigation arrows work
- [ ] Download button works

### 5. Backend Console Logs (Check Terminal)
**Look for these SUCCESS logs**:
```
✅ Added to Known For: Top Gun (1986) - Cover: Yes
✅ Added to Known For: Mission: Impossible (1996) - Cover: Yes
```

**NOT this (old broken version)**:
```
❌ Added to Known For: Tom Cruise is one of the best liked... (2001)
```

---

## 🐛 **KNOWN ISSUES**

1. **Port Conflicts** - Backend sometimes blocks port 3001
   - **Fix**: `taskkill /PID [PID] /F` or restart terminal

2. **Cache Issues** - Browser shows old version
   - **Fix**: Hard refresh (`Ctrl + Shift + R`)

3. **CSS Import Error** - `@import` must precede `@tailwind`
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED in `index.css`

4. **Too Many Doc Files** - 23+ markdown files cluttering repo
   - **Status**: 🔧 IN PROGRESS - Consolidating to 3 files
